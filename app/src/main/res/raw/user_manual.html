          <li><b>User Interface</b>: A chat window is displayed where you can see both your
            questions and the chatbot's responses.
          </li>
          <li><b>Interactivity</b>: To ask a question, simply type it into the input field and tap
            the "Send" or "Submit" button. The chatbot will then analyze your query and provide an
            answer.
          </li>

          <b>4.2. Chatbot Condition: Pervasive vs. Reference</b>
        </h3>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Pervasive Condition</b>: In this mode, the chatbot actively assists you. Upon
            asking
            about any of the supported topics, the chatbot doesn't just provide information, but
            also
            takes proactive steps to help you. For instance, if you ask about "Finding missing
            sensor"
            , the chatbot might start an automatic sensor detection process.
          </li>
          <li><b>Reference Condition</b>: Under this condition, the chatbot acts as a reference
            guide.
            If you ask about "File Sharing or Transfer", it will provide a step-by-step guide on how
            to do so, but the actual implementation is up to you.

        <ul>
          <li><b>Be Specific</b>: For best results, ask specific questions like "How do I initiate
            file sharing?" rather than general ones like "Tell me about file sharing."
          </li>
          <li><b>Rephrase</b>: If the chatbot doesn't understand your query the first time, try
            rephrasing it or breaking it down into simpler terms.
